Adam Tuttle has been developing web applications since 2000, starting with ColdFusion 4.5. In that time he has worked for manufacturing companies, in academia, and as a consultant; but ColdFusion was a constant. He is once again a consultant, this time for [CounterMarch Systems](http://www.countermarch.com). When it comes to work-focus, Adam is a jack of all trades (the curse of consulting), but he specializes in REST, SOA, JavaScript, Security, and Mobile-optimized design.

In addition to working with and speaking about ColdFusion, he is also the Co-manager of the Philadelphia ColdFusion User Group, an Adobe Community Professional for ColdFusion, and maintains a growing library of open source projects, including [Taffy](http://taffy.io). In addition to his own projects, he also contributes to the [Mango Blog](http://www.mangoblog.org) core and several other open source community projects on GitHub. Adam also blogs, mostly about tech stuff, at [fusiongrokker.com](http://fusiongrokker.com).

Apparently that isn't enough to fill his schedule, because he and his wife also have two sons and enjoy camping, hiking, fishing, snowboarding, offbeat tabletop gaming, and cheering for the Phillies.
